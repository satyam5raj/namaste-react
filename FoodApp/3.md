- React File Structure - https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html



- Props - It is something which we can pass to the component 
- Props is an argument to a function 

- Config Driven UI - Based on the data coming from API UI changes

- You always have to use key - unique key
Never use index as the key - React says - https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/
{
    resList.map((restaurant, index) => (
        <RestaurantCard key={index} resData={restaurant}/>
    ))
}

Use this instead
{
    resList.map((restaurant) => (
        <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.info.id} resData={restaurant}/>
    ))
}


- Two types of export 
Named export e.g. export const resList = .......
Default export e.g. export default <Name of componnt>


- React Hooks
