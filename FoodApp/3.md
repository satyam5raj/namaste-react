- React File Structure - https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html



- Props - It is something which we can pass to the component 
- Props is an argument to a function 

- Config Driven UI - Based on the data coming from API UI changes

- You always have to use key - unique key
Never use index as the key - React says - https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/
{
    resList.map((restaurant, index) => (
        <RestaurantCard key={index} resData={restaurant}/>
    ))
}

Use this instead
{
    resList.map((restaurant) => (
        <RestaurantCard key={restaurant.info.id} resData={restaurant}/>
    ))
}


- Two types of export 
Named export e.g. export const resList = .......
Default export e.g. 
export default <Name of componnt>
import <Name of Component> from 'path';


# React Hooks (Normal js utility function)
- State variable - super powerful variable
e.g. const [resList] = useState(); 

- two popular hooks (https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
- useState() - superpowerful state variables in react
- useEffect()

- whenever a state variable updates react rerenders the component 

# React uses Reconciliation algorithm (React Fiber)
- Virtual DOM is a representation of Actual DOM 
- https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture


- Whenever state variable updates , react triggers a reconciliation cycle i.e. react will rerender the component

# useEffect
- If no dependency array ==> useEffect is called on every render 
- If the dependency array is empty = [] ==> useEffect is called on initial render (just once)
- If dependency array is not empty = [btnNameReact] ==> called everytime btnNameReact is updated

# 2 types of routing in webapps
 - Client Side Routing
 - Server Side Routing 

- React is a single page application just the component interchange via client side routing

*** Mounting and Unmounting in Functional Component
e.g.  ------>>>>>>
useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
        console.log("Hello OP")
    }, 1000)

    return () => {
        clearInterval(timer);
        console.log("return")
    }
}, []);
