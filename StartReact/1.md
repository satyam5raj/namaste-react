npm is not node package manager - It is a package manager 
package.json file is the configuration for our npm
package is also known as dependencies

What all things we need to make this app production ready?
1. bundler - which bundles the app or compress the app e.g. - web pack, parcel, vite

2 types of dependencies we can install 
1. dev dependencies e.g. - npm install -D parcel
2. normal dependencies

^ - means updates the minor version automatically in dependencies
~ - means updates the major version automatically in dependencies

package-lock.json keep a track of exact version that is been installed

node_modules contain all the code that we fetch from npm so its collection of dependencies

Transative dependencies - Like when we installed parcel only then also we see more packages in the node_modules along with parcel so like we have dependencies on parcel same this parcel will also have dependencies on something .......

we are at the moment to ignite our app
npx parcel index.html 
so earlier we were running app using index.html but this is not the good way to run 
so it created a server which is running our app at http://localhost:1234

npm is to install a package 
npx is to execute a package 

one to to get react into our app is via cdn links 
another way to get react in our app is via npm 

cdn links is not a good way to bring react and reactDOM in our app beacuse we don't want to make another network call to get react in our app if its there in node_modules via npm
npm install react

when using parcel remove this ( "main": "App.js", ) from package.json
now you can run - npx parcel build index.html (for prod)-  cmd

For this - Differential Bundling - support older browsers
we need to update the package.json as this 
"browserslist": [
    "last 2 Chrome version",
    "last 2 Firefox version"
  ]
